# Conventional Commits

Format all commit messages according to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This enables automated changelog generation, semantic versioning, and better commit history.

## Format Structure

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Commit Types

### SemVer-Mapped Core Types

Use these types when they match the change; they are the only types with
implicit SemVer meaning in the specification:

- **`feat:`** - A new feature (correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning)
- **`fix:`** - A bug fix (correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning)

### Common Additional Types

- **`docs:`** - Documentation only changes
- **`style:`** - Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **`refactor:`** - Code refactoring without bug fixes or new features
- **`perf:`** - Performance improvements
- **`test:`** - Adding or updating tests
- **`build:`** - Build system or external dependencies changes
- **`ci:`** - CI/CD configuration changes
- **`chore:`** - Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **`revert:`** - Reverts a previous commit

## Scope

An optional scope provides additional contextual information about the section of the codebase:

```
feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays
fix(auth): resolve token expiration issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Description

- Must immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope

Style recommendations:
- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature" or "adds feature")
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No period at the end
- Prefer 72 characters or fewer (including type and scope)
- Recommended: 50 characters or fewer for better readability

## Body

- Optional longer description providing additional context
- Must begin one blank line after the description
- Can consist of multiple paragraphs
- Explain the "what" and "why" of the change, not the "how"

## Breaking Changes

Breaking changes can be indicated in two ways:

### 1. Using `!` in the type/scope

```
feat!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
feat(api)!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
```

### 2. Using BREAKING CHANGE footer

```
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
```

The specification also treats `BREAKING-CHANGE:` as a synonymous footer token;
prefer `BREAKING CHANGE:` unless a project convention says otherwise.

### 3. Both methods

```
chore!: drop support for Node 6

BREAKING CHANGE: use JavaScript features not available in Node 6.
```

## Examples

### Simple feature

```
feat: add user authentication
```

### Feature with scope

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 support
```

### Bug fix with body

```
fix: prevent racing of requests

Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss
incoming responses other than from latest request.

Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are
obsolete now.
```

### Breaking change

```
feat!: migrate to new API client

BREAKING CHANGE: The API client interface has changed. All methods now
return Promises instead of using callbacks.
```

### Documentation update

```
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
```

### Multi-paragraph body with footers

```
fix: prevent racing of requests

Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss
incoming responses other than from latest request.

Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are
obsolete now.

## Guidelines

1. **Always use a type** - Every commit must start with a type followed by a colon and space
2. **Use imperative mood** - Write as if completing the sentence "If applied, this commit will..."
3. **Be specific** - The description should clearly communicate what changed
4. **Keep it focused** - One logical change per commit
5. **Use scopes when helpful** - Scopes help categorize changes within a codebase
6. **Document breaking changes** - Always indicate breaking changes clearly

## Semantic Versioning Correlation

- **`fix:`** → PATCH version bump (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
- **`feat:`** → MINOR version bump (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
- **BREAKING CHANGE** → MAJOR version bump (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

## When to Use

Use this format for:
- All git commits
- Commit message generation
- Pull request merge commits
- When the user asks about commit messages or git commits

## Copying messages to the clipboard

When asked to copy a generated commit message to the macOS clipboard,
use a **single-line pipeline** rather than a multi-line heredoc:

✅ `printf '%s\n' 'first line' '' 'body line 1' 'body line 2' | pbcopy && pbpaste`

❌ `cat <<'EOF' | pbcopy` ... `EOF` (multi-line heredoc)

Multi-line heredoc scripts can defeat Claude Code's command-exclusion
matcher and cause `pbcopy` to be blocked by the macOS sandbox, leading
to a flaky `exit 1`. The `printf '%s\n'` form parses as a clean
pipeline, matches the sandbox exclusion reliably, and preserves blank
lines (pass `''` for them).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ `Added new feature` (past tense, capitalized)
✅ `feat: add new feature` (imperative, lowercase)

❌ `fix: bug` (too vague)
✅ `fix: resolve null pointer exception in user service`

❌ `feat: add feature` (redundant)
✅ `feat: add user profile page`

❌ `feat: Added OAuth support.` (past tense, period)
✅ `feat: add OAuth support`
